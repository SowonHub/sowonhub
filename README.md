## 🚀 About Me

I’m a frontend developer specialising in React and TypeScript, building scalable and performant web applications.

Rather than simply delivering features, I focus on measurable performance improvements, server-state optimisation and clean component architecture. I design applications with long-term maintainability, rendering efficiency and product scalability in mind.

Currently targeting mid-level frontend opportunities in Sydney.

## 🎬 Featured Project

### Pop Corn Play  
React · TypeScript · TanStack Query · Supabase · Vite

- Designed and deployed a production-ready movie discovery application.
- Reduced unnecessary API requests by approximately 65–70% by implementing debounce logic and optimising query key structure (measured via Chrome DevTools Network panel).
- Improved Lighthouse performance score from 74 to 92 by optimising image loading and reducing render-blocking resources.
- Reduced bundle size by ~22% through dependency cleanup and modularised imports (measured via Vite build output comparison).
- Refactored component architecture into reusable and isolated modules to improve maintainability.
- Implemented server-state caching and controlled query invalidation using TanStack Query.
- Built authentication and protected routes using Supabase with persistent session handling.

## 🎮 Team Project – PLAYTYPE  
User preference-based game recommendation & community platform  
React · TypeScript · Next.js · Zustand · TanStack Query

- Led implementation of the My Page flow (profile, dashboard, wishlist and review management) using reusable and modular UI components.
- Reduced unnecessary refetching by restructuring query keys and introducing controlled query invalidation, decreasing repeated API calls by approximately 40% (measured via DevTools Network panel).
- Improved list rendering performance by separating global and local state (Zustand + component state), reducing unnecessary re-renders during filter/sort interactions.
- Implemented scalable filtering, sorting and pagination logic to support smooth navigation in large list views.
- Refactored component and folder architecture (UI / hooks / API / constants separation) to improve maintainability and reduce coupling.
- Collaborated in Agile sprint cycles using structured Git branching strategy and PR reviews, ensuring code quality and consistent delivery.

## 🌆 Vision

I aim to contribute to product-driven teams where performance, clean architecture and user experience matter.

Always building. Always refining.
