## 🚀 About Me

I’m a frontend developer specialising in React and TypeScript, building scalable and performant web applications.

Rather than just delivering features, I focus on measurable improvements in performance, server-state optimisation and clean component architecture. I design applications with long-term maintainability and rendering efficiency in mind.

Currently targeting mid-level frontend opportunities in Sydney.
